                    As a society we have a tendency to be curious, to want to know what has unfolded before us, so that we can better understand why we have arrived where we are today.

                    <p>
                    One way to gather answers is to understand who our ancestors were and what they did. Fortunately for the People, Kinsac, Lower Sackville, Lucasville, Middle Sackville and Upper Sackville communities, the Sackville Heritage Archives has thousands of stories waiting to be learned.

                    The archive team at the Fultz House Museum has done their due diligence and have gathered primary and secondary documents from families, social institutions and publications, that document and tell stories of the people who came before us, and even captures moments, in maybe your own timeline, your story.

                    Perhaps your picture was in the newspaper as a teen when you were a newspaper carrier. We may have your birth announcement that appeared in the paper. A yearbook from your high school may be on file, or even your winning dunk shot captured on the basketball court that appeared in the local and provincial papers. Our archival records have immense community value that is searchable by our database.

                    We are always looking to expand our information holdings on the fine people of our communities, including the Kelsie, Lucas, Oliver, Barrett, and Peverill families, to name just a few. Our collection is constantly growing and updated, not only to capture fifty years prior, but last year, last week, yesterday and eventually, tomorrow.

                    <p>
                    We take great pride in knowing that we have built a community treasure trove of information, where people can literally and figuratively, take footsteps into the past and learn about our community builders, our families, the activities that transpired, and so much more.

                    Be mindful that we may have dozens of items on members of one family, but not as much on some others. Literally what we have, has been what we have been given, or have been able to locate, through our dedicated volunteer hours.
